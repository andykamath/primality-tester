#Random Forest and Decision Tree Classification to Determine Primality of a Number

I basically took a dataset of the prime numbers between 1-8000 (primes.txt) and used that as a training set. I tested the classifiers in sets of thousands between 8,000 and 15,485,863 to achieve *100% accuracy*. There must be something wrong because I don't know how I could get an impeccable accuracy otherwise.
